###mycomponent.js(without dependency)###
```javascript
	dhtmlxcomponent({
		name:"myComponent"
		model:mycomponent_model,
		init:function(){
		//This code runs immidatly.
		//write all your initilzation here...
		},
		go:function(){
			//other function
		}

```javascript
	dhtmlxcomponent([
	"path/to/dhtmlx.js",
	"part/to/model.js",
	"path/to/script.js"
	],{
		model:mycomponent_model,
		name:"myComponent",
		init:function(){
		//This code runs immidatly.
		//write all your initilzation here...
		},
		go:function(){
			//other function
		}
	});
``` 

## MVC Really? ##

Ya! dhxCom really support MVC Pattern. The simplest way is by giving type attribute while createing the component. If you didn't provide any type it will take controller as default type.

```javascript
	dhtmlxcomponent({
		name:"myComponent",
		type:"model", //it can be view,model,contorller
		init:function(){
		
		}
	});

```
